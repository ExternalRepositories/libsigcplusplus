# Building libsigc++

On Linux, you would ideally get libsigc++ from your distro's official package.
However, this is about building from source.

## Meson

libsigc++ uses Meson as one of its main build systems,
so you can build or install with the regular meson/ninja steps.
For instance:
  meson --prefix /opt/something --libdir lib yourbuilddir .
then
  cd yourbuilddir
  ninja
  ninja install
You can run the tests like so:
  ninja test
We create the tarball release like so:
  ninja dist


## autotools

libsigc++ uses autotools as one of its main build systems,
so you can build or install with the regular configure/make steps.
For instance:
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/something
then
  make
or
  make install
You can build the examples and tests, and run the tests, like so:
  make check
We create the tarball release like so:
  make distcheck


## CMake

You may also build libsigc++ with CMake, though it's fairly experimental for now.
For instance,
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/something .
then
  make
or
  make install
You can run the tests like so:
  make test


## Microsoft Visual C++

See MSVC_NMake/README.txt.
